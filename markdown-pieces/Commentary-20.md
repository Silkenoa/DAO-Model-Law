With regards to their taxation treatment, the distinction between the
internet and cyberspace, as outlined by Lawrence Lessig, provides a
useful framework to characterize the unique attributes of DAOs vis-a-vis
digital entities hosted in the cloud.[^44] While transactions occurring
over the internet typically entail a clear correspondence with those of
taxable entities with a real-world existence, a DAO cannot be
conventionally connected to an agent or location on Earth. This is
primarily due to the fact that its processes and procedures are
predefined and deterministic, carried out by code existing in
cyberspace. Furthermore, the emergence of blockchain-based anonymization
techniques and decentralized exchanges compromise the enforcement of a
regulatory framework for taxation akin to that of cloud-based agents. In
that sense, David Shakow acknowledges that \"the pure blockchain form
does not work well for an entity under the IRC \[United States Internal
Revenue Code\]\".[^45]

Many questions regarding the taxation of DAO remain unaddressed by the
tax laws of national jurisdictions. These questions, highlighted by
Shakow, include the classification of DAOs as entities under tax law,
the tax residence of DAOs, the level at which investments in DAOs should
be taxed (entity-level or Member-level), the taxation of Members
liquidating their investment, the filing of tax returns and the
treatment of Hard Forks as taxable events for Token-holders who receive
Tokens from the forked chain. In addition, Airdrops as defined in
Article 3(4) pose additional unresolved complexity for the tax laws of
national jurisdictions. Despite the difficulties in achieving regulatory
equivalence, taxation is material for DAOs to recognize the social and
environmental costs inherent in the operation of DAOs that, in the
absence of taxation, would be imposed on other members of society.

As the tokenomics of DAOs imply that the value of a DAO is reflected in
the value of the Token(s) issued by the DAO or governing the DAO, making
DAOs pass-through entities for tax purposes seems to be the correct
approach. As such, the responsibility of paying tax on gains should fall
on Members and Participants, because in the case of unregistered DAOs,
which this Model Law addresses, only Members and Participants are
anchored in a jurisdiction. Accordingly, each Member or Participant is
solely responsible for declaring their financial stake in a DAO, if
required by the jurisdiction in which each Member or Participant is a
tax resident. It should be the sole obligation of the Members or
Participants to declare their capital gains on the disposition of
DAO-related Tokens or similar transactions.

[^1]: The Preamble provides the legal foundations of 'regulatory
    equivalence' and 'functional equivalence', as well as a discussion
    of the widespread recognition of certain forms of transnational
    private legal ordering and, in particular, the work on creating
    model laws for new corporate/organizational forms.

[^2]: *Alegality* is a concept that is useful for understanding actions
    that are currently not seen by the legal system, and that might
    potentially challenge the boundaries of the legal order, and the
    distinction between legal and illegal. Arguably, some of the
    activities undertaken on a public, permissionless blockchain could
    be regarded as *alegal*, either because they are not (yet)
    encompassed by the law, or because they stand outside of its reach.
    For instance, the decentralized nature of public blockchain networks
    makes them virtually impossible to shut down, even if one or more
    states shut down nodes within their jurisdiction. Moreover, because
    smart contract applications are run and executed in a decentralized
    fashion, any smart contracts or DAOs deployed on a public blockchain
    will continue to operate independently of the will of the parties
    deploying them, and will also be impossible to shut down. This
    brings them into the *alegal* realm. This is not to say, however,
    that the law cannot reconstitute its boundaries in order to
    accommodate their existence and to influence their operations. Yet,
    this requires a conscious intervention from the legislator in order
    to recognize them under the law so as to bring them within the scope
    of *legality* or *illegality*, depending on the circumstances. The
    adoption of the DAO Model Law by existing governments is a way for
    them to reconstitute their legal boundaries to accommodate the
    regulation of DAOs within their existing legal framework in a
    harmonized fashion. For more information on alegality, see Hans
    Lindahl, *Fault Lines of Globalization: Legal Orders and the
    Politics of A-legality* (Oxford University Press, 2013); Hans
    Lindahl, 'Border Crossings by Immigrants: Legality, Illegality, and
    Alegality' (2008) 14 Res Publica 117; Hans Lindahl, 'The Opening:
    Alegality and Political Agonism', in Andrew Schaap (Ed.), *Law and
    Agonistic Politics* (Ashgate 2009); Vanja Hamzić, 'Alegality:

[^3]: This understanding draws on, among other things, the principle
    laid down by the US Supreme Court in *Bank of Augusto v. Earle*, 38
    US 519 (1839) that though a legal entity (such as a corporation) is
    an artificial creature of national law and only exists because of
    that law, "it does not by any means follows that its existence there
    will not be recognised in other places; and its residence in one
    state creates no insuperable objection to its power of contracting
    in another." *Also see*, Katharina Pistor, *The Code of Capital: How
    the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality* (Princeton University Press,
    2019), 68.

[^6]: Regulatory equivalence in its most common use refers to the
    equivalence of the regulatory regime of two different jurisdictions,
    often in the context of trade or financial regulations.

[^7]: Note that some jurisdictions have adopted a different approach
    than our Model Law by creating new types of registered DAO forms
    (*e.g.*, Malta, Wyoming) rather than providing a legal framework
    where unregistered DAOs qualify as legal entities if they meet
    certain conditions such as those outlined in the Model Law. In our
    opinion these approaches are limited in that they do not properly
    leverage the technological and crossborder characteristics of
    blockchain technology.
