The Model Law seeks to avoid being overly prescriptive about the
internal organization of DAOs. Therefore, the founders, Administrators
and Members of a DAO have considerable leeway in designing the internal
organization and procedures of the DAO. This is akin to the flexibility
afforded to LLCs in several US states, and to LLPs and private companies
limited by shares in the United Kingdom. Given the nature of DAOs,
several of these procedures will be part of the code of a DAO's Smart
Contracts, but to maximize accessibility to laypersons, these internal
rules and procedures should be accurately represented in the DAO's
By-Laws as set forth in this Articles 11(1) and Article 4(1)(f).
