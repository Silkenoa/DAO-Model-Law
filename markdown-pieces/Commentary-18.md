The Failure Event provisions are analogous to directors' liability under
corporate law. They are intended to address situations in which a person
with decision-making authority in a DAO acts in bad faith or, through
gross negligence, causes a technical failure that harms Members,
Participants, or the general public. As with director liability, there
is not an expectation that a person's decisions or actions will be
perfect, but they must be taken with the best interests of the DAO in
mind and fall within a reasonable range of possible decisions or
actions.

After a Failure Event, legal personality and limited liability will
typically be maintained in order to protect the interests of the DAO
Members and Participants. For example, in the case of a hack, a person
who can be said to have acted in bad faith or through gross negligence
may face liability for losses incurred in the Failure Event, but DAO
Members and Participants who simply took part would still be shielded by
the DAO's legal personhood and limited liability.
