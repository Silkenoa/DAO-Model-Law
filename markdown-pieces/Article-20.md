# 20.  TAXATION OF DAOsâ€•

 
### The taxation of DAOs recognized by this Model Law will be based on the following principles:

(1) By default, any DAO recognized by this Model Law will be treated as
    > a pass-through entity for tax purposes, with no entity-level tax
    > accruing to the DAO. Any realized gains will pass through to the
    > DAO's Members in proportion to their Token holdings.

(2) Where a Member itself is not a taxable entity, such as another DAO,
    > the realized gains allocated to such Members will pass to the
    > first taxable person in the same manner as specified in Article
    > 20(1).
