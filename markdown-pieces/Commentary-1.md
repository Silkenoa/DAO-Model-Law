The aim of the Model Law is to allow a DAO that has not registered as a
for-profit corporate entity or a non-profit entity to benefit from
equivalent standing as a domestic limited liability company or limited
liability cooperative. Most jurisdictions no longer require limited
liability companies to have an object/purpose clause. Instead, many
jurisdictions allow them to engage in any legal activity. The *ultra
vires* doctrine has also fallen out of favor in several advanced
corporate law jurisdictions.[^8] A common exception to this trend is
charitable organisations, which is regularly explained by their special
tax status. The Model Law does not aim to secure any special tax status
for DAOs and accordingly has not taken into account the prevailing
requirement for charitable organisations to have an object/purpose
clause. As such, this Article does not preclude DAOs from engaging in
social, environmental or philanthropic activities alongside its economic
activities. Specifically, the Model Law acknowledges that a DAO may not
only be a for-profit entity but may be used for multiple non-commercial
purposes. DAOs have already been used for non-commercial purposes.[^9]
