    Administrators, with regard to specific, predefined operations of
    the DAO.

(3) **"Airdrop"** means a free distribution of Tokens initiated by a DAO
    to a Public Address, but does not include distributions of Tokens
    for which a person must execute a function to redeem the distributed

    divergent and potentially competing blockchains.

(7) **"Decentralized Autonomous Organization" (DAO)** refers to *smart
    contracts* (*i.e.* blockchain-based software) deployed on a public
    Permissionless Blockchain,[^12] which implements specific
    decision-making or governance rules enabling a multiplicity of

     definition of open source.[^13]

(25) "**Participants**" means any person interacting with or holding
     native tokens in a DAO other than Members.

(26) "**Permissionless Blockchain**" means a public distributed ledger,
     allowing any entity to transact and produce blocks in accordance
     with the blockchain protocol, whereby the validity of the block is
     not determined by the identity of the producer.

     namely: (1) the completion of professional software security audit
     with an audit report available to the public with no significant
     security risks remaining, as well as the completion of a public bug
     bounty; (2) a formal verification by means of a mathematical
     proof-based methodology in which the Smart Contract's bytecode is
     directly checked as correct-by-construction to show the full
     functional correctness of security-critical properties of the Smart
     Contract; or (3) any other process recognized as meeting the same
     security standards.

(33) **"Smart Contract**" is code deployed in a blockchain environment.
     It is made of a set of *predefined* and *deterministic*
     instructions executed in a distributed manner by the nodes of the
