Article 13(1) makes horizontal, direct decision-making the default of
DAOs, as opposed to the vertical, delegated management that can be seen
in the typical Berle-Means corporation. The specific manner in which
decision-making power and tasks are distributed is to be determined by
the DAO itself in its By-Laws. This, naturally, can include opting for
some form of delegated decision-making.

Where a DAO has appointed one or several Administrators(s) to represent
the DAO, the Administrator(s) will be elected by the DAO Members
according to a procedure agreed in the By-Laws of the DAO. The DAO's
public documentation will explicitly state who the authorized
Administrators(s) are.
