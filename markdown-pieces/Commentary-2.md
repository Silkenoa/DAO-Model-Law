The core public policy goal of legal personality is entity shielding.
Attaining legal personality allows an entity to operate as a single
contracting party distinct from those owning or managing the firm, with
a single pool of assets distinct from the other assets of those owning
and managing the firm.[^10] The entity's pool of assets may not be
attached by the personal creditors of those owning or managing the firm,
but only by the creditors of the entity itself. The latter are usually
granted priority over the owners of the firm to the entity's assets. To
protect the entity from forced liquidation, entity shielding usually
also entails rules that prevent the owners of the entity from
withdrawing their share of assets at will.[^11] Through this Article,
the same rationale is extended to DAOs, so as to separate the assets and
liabilities of Members and Participants from that of the DAO.

The Model Law stipulates that jurisdictions should recognize a DAO to
have legal personality so long as they are able to meet the same policy
goals underlying corporate law, as reflected in this Model Law. In order
for this principle to stand, all jurisdictions should adopt the same
criteria for legal personality as prescribed in the Model Law, otherwise
the legal scope of a particular DAO could be fragmented and
unpredictable.
