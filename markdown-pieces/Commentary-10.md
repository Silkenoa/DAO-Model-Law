The protection of minority rights, such as those of minority
shareholders, is an important principle in the corporate law of every
jurisdiction. With respect to DAOs, the ease of entry and exit, in
conjunction with the extensive disclosures inherent to such entities,
act as a first line of protection for minorities against abuses by
majorities. Furthermore, in line with the objective of using the DAO's
Dispute Resolution Mechanism to resolve disputes among Members (Article
4(1)(j)), minority Members may raise a dispute through the mechanism
that is specified at the time of DAO formation. DAOs may wish to provide
even greater protections to minority DAO Members, particularly in the
event of major or contentious decisions and transactions. The Model Law
provides room for such protections to be introduced through the DAO's
By-Laws (Article 10(1)). Several DAOs, for instance, have implemented
"ragequit" features (*e.g.*, MolochDAO, MCV), whereby Members unhappy
with specific decisions may immediately exit the DAO with their
proportional share of On-Chain funds.
