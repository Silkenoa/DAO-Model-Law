In contrast to the rule in some jurisdictions that equity holders, such
as shareholders and cooperative members, cannot be represented by proxy,
the Model Law embraces the contemporary practice of allowing proxy
representation and voting. Delegation of voting rights is already common
in DAOs operating today. For example, in the case of compound.finance,
any COMP holder may delegate their voting rights to another Public
Address.[^41] Many compound.finance votes have been delegated to high
profile ecosystem members.[^42]
