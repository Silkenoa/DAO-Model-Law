# 16.  CONTENTIOUS FORKS IN THE UNDERLYING BLOCKCHAINâ€•

 
### In the event of a Hard Fork in the underlying Permissionless Blockchain: 

(1) By default, the legal representation of the DAO remains on the
    Majority Chain and any Off-Chain Assets will belong to the DAO on
    the Majority Chain.

(2) The DAO may choose to maintain legal presence on a Minority Chain if
    it expresses its intent to do so by Public Signaling, and in that
    case any Off-Chain Assets will belong to the DAO on the selected
    Minority Chain.

(3) The DAO may liquidate its On-Chain Assets following a Hard Fork in
    order to move those Assets to the chosen chain.

(4) Alternatively, the DAO may choose to split into multiple legal
    entities, each on a separate chain, if it communicates by Public
    Signaling:

    a.  its intent to do so, and

    b.  there is a definitive distribution of Off-Chain Assets between
        the Majority and Minority Chain(s).
