    d.  The software code of the DAO must have undergone Quality
        > Assurance;

    e.  There must be at least one GUI that will allow a layperson to
        > read the value of the key variables of the DAO's smart
        > contracts and monitor all transactions originating from, or

    f.  The DAO must have By-Laws that are comprehensible to a
        > layperson. The By-Laws must be publicly accessible via a GUI
        > or a Public Forum. Sensitive information may be redacted from

        > necessary to protect the privacy of individual Members or
        > Participants in the DAO;

    g.  The governance system of the DAO must be technically
        > decentralized, although not necessarily operationally
        > decentralized, as per Article 3(7).

        > be at least one Member of the DAO at any given time;

    i.  There must be a publicly specified mechanism that allows a

        > communication mechanism;

    j.  The DAO must refer to or provide a Dispute Resolution Mechanism
        > that the DAO, Members and Participants will be bound by;

    k.  The DAO must refer to or provide a Dispute Resolution Mechanism
        > to resolve any disputes with third parties that, by their
        > nature, are capable of being settled by alternative dispute
        > resolution.

(2) The DAO will, upon meeting the formation requirements in Article
    > 4(1), have limited liability by default, subject to the provisions
    > of Article 5.

(3) Concurrent fulfillment of the requirements in Article 4(1), and an
    > announcement by the DAO that it has fulfilled those requirements
    > is deemed conclusive evidence of the DAO's recognition under this
    > Model Law and does not require certification from, or registration
    > by, an Accreditation Authority.

(4) A jurisdiction adopting the Model Law may authorize an Accreditation
    > Authority to monitor whether a DAO continues to meet the
    > requirements for legal personality under the Model Law.

(5) A DAO may request confirmation from an Accreditation Authority, if
    > such an authority exists, to determine whether the DAO complies
    > with the requirements for legal personality under the Model Law.
