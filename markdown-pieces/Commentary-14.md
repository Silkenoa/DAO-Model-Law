The position of Legal Representative was created to enable DAOs to
engage with Off-Chain systems and processes, which may be increasingly
necessary as DAOs become involved in increasingly complex tasks and
activities as well as engagement with traditional third party entities.
As it cannot be expected that all foreseeable actors will interact with
the DAO On-Chain, the appointment of a Legal Representative allows for
DAOs to undertake specific tasks and activities---without leading to
classification of such Persons as fiduciaries of DAOs.

To give third parties transacting with DAOs assurance that a person is
authorized by the DAO as a Legal Representative, the continued validity
of an authorization should be verifiable by cryptographic proof and
simultaneous post in the Public Forum. If the authorization of a Legal
Representative is withdrawn, it should be withdrawn in the Public Forum
in which it was originally granted, as well as On-Chain, in order to
prevent tampering. In this instance, an example of a Public Forum could
be a website administered by a centralized operator or hosted in a
decentralized manner. A cryptographic proof could be a plain text
message cryptographically signed by a DAO multisig or individually by a
quorum of signers.
