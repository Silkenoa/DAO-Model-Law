There may be a few instances in which the By-Laws of a DAO and the Model
Law are not able to address all of the organizational and governance
issues that arise from the operation of a DAO. In such circumstances,
the general business organization law of the State that recognizes the
DAO may be used to address these lacunae. However, as general business
organization laws are generally drafted with centralized organizations
in mind, applying these laws may present their own difficulties. As a
consequence, any such application of general business organization laws
must only be done if the By-Laws and Model Law cannot be applied and any
resulting ambiguity must be resolved in a manner that upholds the letter
and objectives of the Model Law. These objectives can be found in the
Preamble of this Model Law.
